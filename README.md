## Seqtrak Cases for Charity 

I will, at my expense, print and ship a Seqtrak protective case to you, on the **pledge** you'll donate an appropriate amount of money to a **food bank**.  

Suggested donations are:

 + $35+: Black or Green with either blank face, or "Wombat Industries" as seen in the pictures.
 + $40+: You pick the color.
 + $50+: Custom lettering (includes custom color)

## How do I join in on this absurd idea?

Email me at [**WombatIndustries@proton.me**](mailto:WombatIndustries@proton.me), your desired configuration and address and I'll send it out.  

**Please** email me back when you get the case, and let me konw you got it, that it's indeed awesome, any feedback, and pretty-please confirm you've donated to a food bank.  This lets me know this crazy idea is working, and gives me the strength to carry on :)

## The case



## FAQ

### Why are you doing this?

After creating this design, I had a handful of people ask for an etsy page to buy one.  I don't really want to start a printing business, but I do want to help people, and share my **glorious** case.

My local foodbank claims $35 dollars makes up to 175 meals.  That's a lot of meals.  A big portion of people who need food banks are elderly, children, or elderly taking care of children.  

### What ensures I actually donate to a Food Bank?

Absolutely nothing, other than honor, guilt, pride, etc...  I have a hunch more people will opt to donate **MORE** than the suggested amount than people will take advantage of this generous offer!

### I'm to lazy to look up a foodbank, can you suggest one? 

Yes. My local food bank (which does a great job) is **RoadRunner Foodbank of New Mexico**.  New Mexico is definitely on the list of states that really need help.
